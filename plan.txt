9 inputs for each board, one for colour, and one bias
hidden layer of 9 neurons, and 9 outputs for each square

init: generate n random players; n=5
winners = []
->

tournament: generate n random opponents to play against
and also human to play?
 -> 1 on cross, 1 on noughts
 -> score and reorder based on score
 -> append winner of each round
 
evolution: take top 2 winners direction, and subsequently

probability of selecting parent from place i is 1/(2^i)
then random selection of weight from each parent

generate n in new generation.


__
to do: play computer vs human

merge game into ttt
+ score best of 10

__
probably should have used 18 neurons to avoid the symmetry issue. The theta values are all positive and get very large
perhaps should limit theta values to 50 or something.
